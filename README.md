# Endpoint Mapping & Secure Architecture

## Overview
Comprehensive endpoint security assessment and secure architecture analysis incorporating NIST 800-53 control gap analysis. This project provides a detailed inventory of organizational assets, evaluates compliance with regulatory standards, and outlines a phased strategy for implementing security improvements across the infrastructure.

## Objectives
- Map and assess all endpoints and network infrastructure
- Identify critical security control gaps against NIST SP 800-53 Rev 5 framework
- Evaluate compliance with regulatory standards
- Develop phased remediation strategy for security improvements
- Strengthen confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information systems

## Methodology
**Assessment Approach:**
- Comprehensive endpoint inventory and classification
- Security controls mapping against NIST SP 800-53 framework
- Gap analysis identifying missing or inadequate controls
- Risk assessment of identified vulnerabilities
- Business impact analysis for prioritization

**Analysis Framework:**
- NIST SP 800-53 Revision 5 standards
- Regulatory compliance requirements (PCI-DSS, HIPAA, etc.)
- Industry best practices for secure architecture
- Risk management principles for prioritization

## Key Findings
- Identified 18 critical security control gaps
- Documented current security landscape and existing architecture
- Mapped business requirements to security objectives
- Developed phased implementation strategy
- Provided specific recommendations for network, data, endpoint, IAM, cloud, and incident response security
